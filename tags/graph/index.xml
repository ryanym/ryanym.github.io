      <description>Binary Tree A binary tree is a special type of graph which cannot have any cycles. It is very different from binary search tree in term of properties and usage. Binary tree is an efficient way of representing hiearchical data, and its advanced forms are widely used in implementing database indices, sorting algorithms, encoders and decision-making process.
Binary Tree problems are great to test one&#39;s ability to think recursively, since recursion one of the fundamentals of CS.</description>
