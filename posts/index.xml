      <description>In hadoop we can have multiple namespaces in hdfs-site.xml for HDFS clients. This is achieved by a HDFS feature called: HDFS Federation
Why do you need multiple namespaces This feature is particularly useful when you need to distcp data between multiple highly available remote hadoop clusters. For HA clusters we don&#39;t always know the address of active namenode and it&#39;s not recommanded to hardcode the active namenode address in the distcp command in case of namenode fail over.</description>

      <description>Recently I had to run some Q-learning algorithms on my home desktop (running on Ubuntu 18). These workloads, depends on the model and hyper parameters, could take a while to finish. If I’m away from home and still wants to work on this project, my options would be:
  Run the algorithms on my Macbook pro and thus starting a fire somewhere
  Run the algorithms on the cloud, cheapest computation optimized instance costs $0.</description>
