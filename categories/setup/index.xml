      <description>Recently I had to run some Q-learning algorithms on my home desktop (running on Ubuntu 18). These workloads, depends on the model and hyper parameters, could take a while to finish. If I’m away from home and still wants to work on this project, my options would be:
  Run the algorithms on my Macbook pro and thus starting a fire somewhere
  Run the algorithms on the cloud, cheapest computation optimized instance costs $0.</description>
